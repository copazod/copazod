### Hello! 👋

I’m an enthusiastic Civil Engineer getting into the ‘tech’ world… and so far… I’m loving it!! 🤩

Currently I’m practicing Python after doing some online courses.

And I also got fascinated about Cloud technologies! 😄

Recently I obtained my first certification as a AWS Cloud Practitioner and now I’m studying to get the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate.

I’m looking forward to be part of the IT world in my near future!! Wish me luck! 🤞
