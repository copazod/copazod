### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an enthusiastic Civil Engineer getting into the â€˜techâ€™ world ... and so far ... Iâ€™m loving it!! ðŸ¤©

Currently Iâ€™m practicing Python after doing some online courses .... I also got fascinated about Cloud technologies! ðŸ˜„

Recently I obtained my first certification as a AWS Cloud Practitioner and now Iâ€™m studying to get the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate.

Iâ€™m looking forward to be part of the IT world in my near future!! Wish me luck! ðŸ¤ž
