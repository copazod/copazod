### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Carolina, an enthusiastic Civil Engineer getting into the â€˜techâ€™ world ... and so far ... Iâ€™m loving it!! ðŸ¤©

Last year, I obtained my first certification as a AWS Cloud Practitioner and since then I got fascinated about Cloud & DevOps technologies! 

Currently Iâ€™m doing a mini-bootcamp for learning the complete Software Development Life Cycle ðŸ˜„

Iâ€™m looking forward to be part of the IT world in my near future!! 

Wish me luck! ðŸ¤ž
